 ## Supported platforms

 VOLK aims to be portable to as many platforms as possible. We can only run tests on some platforms.

 ### OS / Distro
 We run tests on a variety of Ubuntu versions and aim to support as many current distros as possible.
-The same goal applies to differenct OSes. Although this does only happen rarely, it might occur that VOLK does not work on obsolete distros, e.g. Ubuntu 12.04.

 ### Compilers
-We want to make sure VOLK works with C/C++ standard compliant compilers. Most notably GCC and Clang.
-Other compilers that fail to be standard compliant, e.g. MSVC or AppleClang, do also receive attention but some functionality might be missing with these compilers due to lack of standard support.
+We want to make sure VOLK works with C/C++ standard compliant compilers. Of course, as an open source project we focus on open source compilers, most notably GCC and Clang.
+We work want to make sure VOLK compiles on a wide variety of compilers. Thus, we target AppleClang and MSVC as well. Mind that MSVC lacks `aligned_alloc` support for aligned arrays. We use MSVC specific instructions in this case which cannot be `free`'d with `free`.
