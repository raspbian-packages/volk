VOLK is going to migrating from GPLv3 (GNU General Public license version 3.0)
to LGPLv3 (GNU Lesser General Public License version 3.0).

This file is a list of the authors who agreed to grant an LGPL license to the
code they contributed to this repository. In case the affected code is currently
licensed differently (GPLv3), this gives the right to use the current
contributions under both LGPLv3 and that other license. Future contributions by
these authors are, however, licensed under LGPLv3, unless explicitly stated
otherwise.

Together with the date of agreement, these authors are:

| Date | Author (as used in commits) |
|------+-----------------------------|
|      |                             |
