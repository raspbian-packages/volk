## [2.3.0] - 2020-05-09

Hi everyone!

VOLK 2.3 is out! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them. We saw lots of great improvements.

On GNU Radio 'master' VOLK was finally removed as a submodule.

Currently we see ongoing discussions on how to improve CPU feature detection because VOLK is not as reliable as we'd like it to be in that department. We'd like to benefit from other open source projects and don't want to reinvent the wheel. Thus, one approach would be to include `cpu_features` as a submodule.

### Highlights

* Better reproducible builds
* CMake improvements
    - ORC is removed from the public interface where it was never supposed to be.
    - CMake fixes for better usability
* Updated and new CI chain
    - TravisCI moved to new distro and does more tests for newer GCC/Clang
    - Github Actions
        - Add Action to check proper code formatting.
        - Add CI that also runs on MacOS with XCode.
* Enforce C/C++ coding style via clang-format
* Kernel fixes
    - Add puppet for `power_spectral_density` kernel
    - Treat the `mod_range` puppet as a puppet for correct use with `volk_profile`
    - Fix `index_max` kernels
    - Fix `rotator`. We hope that we finally found the root cause of the issue.
* Kernel optimizations
    - Updated log10 calcs to use faster log2 approach
    - Optimize `complexmultiplyconjugate`
* New kernels
    - accurate exp kernel is finally merged after years
    - Add 32f_s32f_add_32f kernel to perform vector + scalar float operation

## [2.4.0] - 2020-11-22

Hi everyone!

We have another VOLK release! We're happy to announce VOLK v2.4.0! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We introduce `cpu_features` as a private submodule in this release because we use it to detect CPU features during runtime now. This should enable more reliable feature detection. Further, it takes away the burden to implement platform specific code. As a result, optimized VOLK kernels build for MacOS and Windows with AppleClang/MSVC out-of-the-box now.


### Highlights

* Documentation
    - Update README to be more verbose and to improve usefulness.

* Compilers
    - MSVC: Handle compiler flags and thus architecture specific kernels correctly. This enables optimized kernels with MSVC builds.
    - AppleClang: Treat AppleClang as Clang.
    - Paired with the `cpu_features` introduction, this enables us to use architecture specific kernels on a broader set of platforms.
* CI
    - Update to newest version of the Intel SDE
    - Test the rotator kernel with a realistic scalar
    - Introduce more test cases with newer GCC and newer Clang versions.
* CMake
    - Enable to not install `volk_modtool`.
    - Remove "find_package_handle_standard_args" warning.
* cpu_features
    - Use `cpu_features` v0.6.0 as a private submodule to detect available CPU features.
    - Fix incorrect feature detection for newer AVX versions.
    - Circumvent platform specific feature detection.
    - Enable more architecture specific kernels on more platforms.
* Kernels
    - Disable slow and broken SSE4.1 kernel in `volk_32fc_x2_dot_prod_32fc`
    - Adjust min/max for `32f_s32f_convert_8i` kernel
    - Use `INT8_*` instead of `CHAR_*`

## [2.5.0] - 2021-06-05

Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK release! We are happy to announce VOLK v2.5.0! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

This release adds new kernel implementations and fixes. Some of these were longstanding PRs that could only be merged recently thanks to our switch from CLA to DCO.

### Announcements

I would like to point out one upcoming change. After this release, we will rename our development branch to `main` as discussed in [issue #461](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/issues/461).


I'd like to point the community to this [VOLK relicensing GREP](https://github.com/gnuradio/greps/pull/33).
This is an ongoing effort to relicense VOLK under LGPLv3.
We're looking for people and organizations that are interested in leading this effort.

## [2.5.1] - 2022-02-12

Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK release! We are happy to announce VOLK v2.5.1! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

The list of contributors is pretty long this time due to a lot of support to relicense VOLK under LGPL. Currently, we are "almost there" but need a few more approvals, please support us. We thank everyone for their support in this effort.

We use `cpu_features` for a while now. This maintainance release should make it easier for package maintainers, FreeBSD users, and M1 users to use VOLK. Package maintainers should be able to use an external `cpu_features` module. For everyone else, `cpu_features` received support for M1 and FreeBSD.

You can find [VOLK on Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3360942](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3360942).
We started to actively support Zenodo now via a `.zenodo.json` file. This might come in handy for people who use VOLK in publications. As a contributor, if you want more information about yourself added to VOLK, feel free to add your ORCiD and affiliation.

In the past, we relied on Boost for several tasks in `volk_profile`. For years, we minimized Boost usage to `boost::filesystem`. We mostly switched to C++17 `std::filesystem` years ago. The last distribution in our CI system that required Boost to build VOLK, was Ubuntu 14.04. Thus, now is the time to remove the Boost dependency completely and rely on C++17 features.

Some VOLK kernels are untested for years. We decided to deprecate these kernels but assume that nobody uses them anyways. If your compiler spits out a warning that you use a deprecated kernel, get in touch. Besides, we received fixes for various kernels. Especially FEC kernels are notoriously difficult to debug because issues often pop up as performance regressions.

Finally, we saw a lot of housekeeping in different areas. Scripts to support us in our LGPL relicensing effort, updated docs, and updated our code of conduct. We could remove some double entries in our QA system and fixed a `volk_malloc` bug that ASAN reported.
Finally, we switched to the Python `sysconfig` module in our build system to ensure Python 3.12+ does not break our builds.

## [2.5.2] - 2022-09-04

Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK release! We are happy to announce VOLK v2.5.2! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We are happy to announce that our re-licensing effort is complete. This has been a long and challenging journey. Being technical: There are 3 people left (out of 74) who we haven't been able to get in contact with (at all), for a total of 4 (out of 1092) commits, 13 (of 282822) additions, and 7 (of 170421) deletions. We have reviewed these commits and all are simple changes (e.g., 1 line change) and most are no longer relevant (e.g., to a file that no longer exists). VOLK maintainers are in agreement that the combination -- small numbers of changes per committer, simple changes per commit, commits no longer relevant -- means that we can proceed with re-licensing without the approval of the folks. We will try reaching out periodically to these folks, but we believe it unlikely we will get a reply.

This maintainance release is intended to be the last VOLK 2.x release. After we completed our re-licensing effort, we want to make a VOLK 3.0 release soon. VOLK 3.0 will be fully compatible with VOLK 2.x on a technical level. However, VOLK 3+ will be released under LGPL. We are convinced a license change justifies a major release.

## [3.0.0] - 2023-01-14

Hi everyone!

This is the VOLK v3.0.0 major release! This release marks the conclusion of a long lasting effort to complete [GREP 23](https://github.com/gnuradio/greps/blob/main/grep-0023-relicense-volk.md) that proposes to change the VOLK license to LGPLv3+. We would like to thank all VOLK contributors that they allowed this re-licensing effort to complete. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

For VOLK users it is important to not that the VOLK API does NOT change in this major release. After a series of discussion we are convinced a license change justifies a major release. Thus, you may switch to VOLK 3 and enjoy the additional freedom the LGPL offers.

### Motivation for the switch to LGPLv3+

We want to remove usage entry barriers from VOLK. As a result, we expect greater adoption and a growing user and contributor base of VOLK. This move helps to spread the value of Free and Open Source Software in the SIMD community, which so far is dominated by non-FOSS software. Moreover, we recognize the desire of our long term contributors to be able to use VOLK with their contributions in their projects. This may explicitly include proprietary projects. We want to enable all contributors to be able to use VOLK wherever they want. At the same time, we want to make sure that improvements to VOLK itself are easily obtained by everyone, i.e. strike a balance between permissiveness and strict copyleft.

Since VOLK is a library it should choose a fitting license. If we see greater adoption of VOLK in more projects, we are confident that we will receive more contributions. May it be bug fixes, new kernels or even contributions to core features.

Historically, VOLK was part of GNU Radio. Thus, it made total sense to use GPLv3+ just like GNU Radio. Since then, VOLK became its own project with its own repository and leadership. While it is still a core dependency of GNU Radio and considers GNU Radio as its main user, others may want to use it too. Especially, long term VOLK contributors may be able to use VOLK in a broader set of projects now.

After a fruitful series of discussions we settled on the LGPLv3+. We believe this license strikes a good balance between permissiveness and strict copyleft for VOLK. We hope to foster contributions to VOLK. Furthermore, we hope to see VOLK usage in a wider set of projects.

### Contributors

The VOLK 3.0.0 release is only possible because all contributors helped to make it possible. Thus, we omit a list of contributors that contributed since the last release.
Instead we want to thank everyone again!

### Changes

* License switch to LGPLv3+
* Fix build for 32 bit arm with neon
* Add experimental support for MIPS and RISC-V


## [3.1.0] - 2023-12-05

Hi everyone!

This is the VOLK v3.1.0 release! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

This release introduces new kernels, fixes a lot of subtle bugs, and introduces an updated API that allows VOLK to run on PowerPC and MIPS platforms without issues. Namely, complex scalar values are passed to kernels by pointer instead of by value. The old API is still around and will be for the whole VOLK v3 release cycle. However, it is recommended to switch to the new API for improved compatibility. Besides, we saw improvements to our `cpu_features` usage that should make it easier for package maintainers. Finally, a lot of tests received fixes that allow our CI to run without hiccups.
