## [2.0.0] - 2019-08-06

This is the first version to use semantic versioning. It starts the logging of changes.


## [2.1.0] - 2019-12-22

Hi everyone,

we would like to announce that Michael Dickens and Johannes Demel are the new VOLK maintainers. We want to review and merge PRs in a timely manner as well as commenting on issues in order to resolve them.

We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We're curious about VOLK users. Especially we'd like to learn about VOLK users who use VOLK outside GNU Radio.

If you have ideas for VOLK enhancements, let us know. Start with an issue to discuss your idea. We'll be happy to see new features get merged into VOLK.

### Highlights

VOLK v2.1.0 is a collection of really cool changes. We'd like to highlight some of them.

- The AVX FMA rotator bug is fixed
- VOLK offers `volk::vector<>` for C++ to follow RAII
- Move towards modern dependencies
    - CMake 3.8
    - Prefer Python3
        - We will drop Python2 support in a future release!
    - Use C++17 `std::filesystem`
        - This enables VOLK to be built without Boost if available!
- more stable CI
- lots of bugfixes
- more optimized kernels, especially more NEON versions

## [2.2.0] - 2020-02-16

Hi everyone,

we have a new VOLK release v2.2.0!

We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We're curious about VOLK users. Especially we'd like to learn about VOLK users who use VOLK outside GNU Radio.

If you have ideas for VOLK enhancements, let us know. Start with an issue to discuss your idea. We'll be happy to see new features get merged into VOLK.

The v2.1.0 release was rather large because we had a lot of backlog. We aim for more incremental releases in order to get new features out there.

### Highlights

VOLK v2.2.0 updates our build tools and adds support functionality to make it easier to use VOLK in your projects.

* Dropped Python 2 build support
    - Removed Python six module dependency
* Use C11 aligned_alloc whenever possible
    - MacOS `posix_memalign` fall-back
    - MSVC `_aligned_malloc` fall-back
* Add VOLK version in `volk_version.h` (included in `volk.h`)
* Improved CMake code
* Improved code with lots of refactoring and performance tweaks
