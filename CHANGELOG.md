## [2.1.0] - 2019-12-22

Hi everyone,

we would like to announce that Michael Dickens and Johannes Demel are the new VOLK maintainers. We want to review and merge PRs in a timely manner as well as commenting on issues in order to resolve them.

We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We're curious about VOLK users. Especially we'd like to learn about VOLK users who use VOLK outside GNU Radio.

If you have ideas for VOLK enhancements, let us know. Start with an issue to discuss your idea. We'll be happy to see new features get merged into VOLK.

### Highlights

## [2.2.0] - 2020-02-16

Hi everyone,

we have a new VOLK release v2.2.0!

We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We're curious about VOLK users. Especially we'd like to learn about VOLK users who use VOLK outside GNU Radio.

If you have ideas for VOLK enhancements, let us know. Start with an issue to discuss your idea. We'll be happy to see new features get merged into VOLK.

The v2.1.0 release was rather large because we had a lot of backlog. We aim for more incremental releases in order to get new features out there.

### Highlights

* Dropped Python 2 build support
    - Removed Python six module dependency
* Use C11 aligned_alloc whenever possible
    - MacOS `posix_memalign` fall-back
    - MSVC `_aligned_malloc` fall-back
* Add VOLK version in `volk_version.h` (included in `volk.h`)
* Improved CMake code
* Improved code with lots of refactoring and performance tweaks

## [2.3.0] - 2020-05-09

Hi everyone!

VOLK 2.3 is out! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them. We saw lots of great improvements.

On GNU Radio 'master' VOLK was finally removed as a submodule.

Currently we see ongoing discussions on how to improve CPU feature detection because VOLK is not as reliable as we'd like it to be in that department. We'd like to benefit from other open source projects and don't want to reinvent the wheel. Thus, one approach would be to include `cpu_features` as a submodule.

### Highlights

* Better reproducible builds
* CMake improvements
    - ORC is removed from the public interface where it was never supposed to be.
    - CMake fixes for better usability
* Updated and new CI chain
    - TravisCI moved to new distro and does more tests for newer GCC/Clang
    - Github Actions
        - Add Action to check proper code formatting.
        - Add CI that also runs on MacOS with XCode.
* Enforce C/C++ coding style via clang-format
* Kernel fixes
    - Add puppet for `power_spectral_density` kernel
    - Treat the `mod_range` puppet as a puppet for correct use with `volk_profile`
    - Fix `index_max` kernels
    - Fix `rotator`. We hope that we finally found the root cause of the issue.
* Kernel optimizations
    - Updated log10 calcs to use faster log2 approach
    - Optimize `complexmultiplyconjugate`
* New kernels
    - accurate exp kernel is finally merged after years
    - Add 32f_s32f_add_32f kernel to perform vector + scalar float operation

## [2.4.0] - 2020-11-22

Hi everyone!

We have another VOLK release! We're happy to announce VOLK v2.4.0! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

We introduce `cpu_features` as a private submodule in this release because we use it to detect CPU features during runtime now. This should enable more reliable feature detection. Further, it takes away the burden to implement platform specific code. As a result, optimized VOLK kernels build for MacOS and Windows with AppleClang/MSVC out-of-the-box now.


### Highlights

* Documentation
    - Update README to be more verbose and to improve usefulness.

* Compilers
    - MSVC: Handle compiler flags and thus architecture specific kernels correctly. This enables optimized kernels with MSVC builds.
    - AppleClang: Treat AppleClang as Clang.
    - Paired with the `cpu_features` introduction, this enables us to use architecture specific kernels on a broader set of platforms.
* CI
    - Update to newest version of the Intel SDE
    - Test the rotator kernel with a realistic scalar
    - Introduce more test cases with newer GCC and newer Clang versions.
* CMake
    - Enable to not install `volk_modtool`.
    - Remove "find_package_handle_standard_args" warning.
* cpu_features
    - Use `cpu_features` v0.6.0 as a private submodule to detect available CPU features.
    - Fix incorrect feature detection for newer AVX versions.
    - Circumvent platform specific feature detection.
    - Enable more architecture specific kernels on more platforms.
* Kernels
    - Disable slow and broken SSE4.1 kernel in `volk_32fc_x2_dot_prod_32fc`
    - Adjust min/max for `32f_s32f_convert_8i` kernel
    - Use `INT8_*` instead of `CHAR_*`

## [2.5.0] - 2021-06-05

Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK release! We are happy to announce VOLK v2.5.0! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

This release adds new kernel implementations and fixes. Some of these were longstanding PRs that could only be merged recently thanks to our switch from CLA to DCO.

### Announcements

I would like to point out one upcoming change. After this release, we will rename our development branch to `main` as discussed in [issue #461](https://github.com/gnuradio/volk/issues/461).


I'd like to point the community to this [VOLK relicensing GREP](https://github.com/gnuradio/greps/pull/33).
This is an ongoing effort to relicense VOLK under LGPLv3.
We're looking for people and organizations that are interested in leading this effort.

## [2.5.1] - 2022-02-12

Hi everyone!

We have a new VOLK release! We are happy to announce VOLK v2.5.1! We want to thank all contributors. This release wouldn't have been possible without them.

The list of contributors is pretty long this time due to a lot of support to relicense VOLK under LGPL. Currently, we are "almost there" but need a few more approvals, please support us. We thank everyone for their support in this effort.

We use `cpu_features` for a while now. This maintainance release should make it easier for package maintainers, FreeBSD users, and M1 users to use VOLK. Package maintainers should be able to use an external `cpu_features` module. For everyone else, `cpu_features` received support for M1 and FreeBSD.

You can find [VOLK on Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3360942](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3360942).
We started to actively support Zenodo now via a `.zenodo.json` file. This might come in handy for people who use VOLK in publications. As a contributor, if you want more information about yourself added to VOLK, feel free to add your ORCiD and affiliation.

In the past, we relied on Boost for several tasks in `volk_profile`. For years, we minimized Boost usage to `boost::filesystem`. We mostly switched to C++17 `std::filesystem` years ago. The last distribution in our CI system that required Boost to build VOLK, was Ubuntu 14.04. Thus, now is the time to remove the Boost dependency completely and rely on C++17 features.

Some VOLK kernels are untested for years. We decided to deprecate these kernels but assume that nobody uses them anyways. If your compiler spits out a warning that you use a deprecated kernel, get in touch. Besides, we received fixes for various kernels. Especially FEC kernels are notoriously difficult to debug because issues often pop up as performance regressions.

Finally, we saw a lot of housekeeping in different areas. Scripts to support us in our LGPL relicensing effort, updated docs, and updated our code of conduct. We could remove some double entries in our QA system and fixed a `volk_malloc` bug that ASAN reported.
Finally, we switched to the Python `sysconfig` module in our build system to ensure Python 3.12+ does not break our builds.
